      <p>Hi everyone! My name is <b>Silas Bartha</b>, and I'm super excited to be working with you in this program, about which I have heard so many wonderful things! Allow me to take this opportunity to introduce myself.</p>

      <p>I'm originally from London, Ontario, where I lived with my family and 3 cats (allergic, by the way), but I moved to Waterloo last weekend in order to become a full-time student at Conestoga. I took the SET program as a way to fulfill my lifelong dream of working in software development.</p>

      <p>I can never turn down a half-decent cup of coffee, that'll be the death of me someday. Interests of mine, aside from programming, include philosophy (shoot some metaphysics my way sometime), reading, and history (particularly internet history, if you couldn't tell).</p>

      <p>Programming has been a pretty constant source of enjoyment throughout my life so far, ever since I got my first ThinkPad ages ago. It was especially helpful during more recent times, following the unfortunate suicide of my best friend last summer. Absorbing myself in programming served both to keep me productive and grounded when I felt that reality was falling apart.</p>

      <p>Sorry to get kind of heavy back there. But in any case, I'm truly excited to see where this program takes me, and all of you as well. I'm sure these next few years will pass like a blur, so I can't wait to start gaining lasting knowledge and connections.</p>
